These instructions were pieced together from a number of locations, but most of it is documented here:
https://docs.sonatype.org/display/Repository/Sonatype+OSS+Maven+Repository+Usage+Guide#SonatypeOSSMavenRepositoryUsageGuide-7a.DeploySnapshotsandStageReleaseswithMaven

Prerequisites:

0.1.  Always run these commands from git bash rather than the regular windows command line, since git bash can be 
configured to run ssh-agent on startup (https://help.github.com/articles/working-with-ssh-key-passphrases), 
and ssh-agent will be needed in later steps.

0.2.  Prepare github ssh keys according to these instructions: https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys

0.3.  Make sure the public and private gpg keys are loaded into the keyring:

gpg --import public.key
gpg --allow-secret-key-import --import private.key

0.4.  Make sure the github ssh private key (id_rsa) is loaded into the ssh keyring (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4520578/sharing-ssh-keys).

Instructions for how to perform a release:

1.  mvn clean deploy

This uploads a snapshot version to oss.sonatype.org.  This is a prerequisite to uploading staging versions, as the 
release:prepare maven task verifies the contents of pom.xml locally with the snapshot version on OSSRH.

2.  mvn release:clean

Deletes release.properties and pom.xml.releaseBackup, if they exist.

3.  mvn release:prepare

Automatically alters pom.xml with the staging version, pushes, releases, alters pom.xml with the next snapshot version, pushes again.
In order for this to work, maven has to be able to push to the github repository, meaning we have some SSH work to do...

4.  mvn release:perform

Builds the prepared release once more and uploads it to the staging repository.

5.  Login to OSS sonatype and "close" the repository.  Once it is closed "release" the repository.  Within 2 hours, central sync will pick up the release and put it in Maven central.
